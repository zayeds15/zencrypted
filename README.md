Zencrypted is a start-up founded by myself and my partner Zayd Syed. We've worked together for over a decade, and have dedicated ourselves to leaving behind a remarkable change in this world.
### What is Zencrypted?
Now, what exactly is Zencrypted? The world is seeing a lot of advancements, while they may be good, there is also an exponentially growing darkside forming that the world is yet to embrace. Believe it or not, ChatGPT and other AI tools were at once capable of being jailbroken to write malware for people. Though it may be patched, AI is creating an upcoming wave of a new form of cyber attacks the world has yet to face: AI Assisted Attacks. Not to mention the various and endless kinds of attacks that can be created from AI, but a few are the bare minimum, such as phishing, trojan horses, and simple cryptojacking malwares. 

The solution? Zencrypted. We are continously dedicating our time towards refining our programming skills and creating different programs/applications that can aid and protect average citizens from potential threats. You don't need to be a big shot to be affected by these kinds of attacks, they can come whenever and from wherever. It could be at your local coffee shop as well. We offer various free lessons and programs that can help protect and educate you, friends, and family members. Check back continously for more updates, as we are only getting started.
